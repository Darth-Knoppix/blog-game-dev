I have been very busy lately with work, university and other studies.  
This means I have had very little time for updating this blog and doing the things I want to do. I will review the last project I began and see if I want to continue it or move on to something different. I will try to free up some time next month and continue to document my experiences.  
  
Thanks for viewing my blog and I hope you gain something from it.
