I am posting some more content which is related to asset creation in 3D. Although it is not directly used in a project, the skills I have used and am learning contribute to my overall knowledge of 3D modelling for use in video games.  
  
This content will be included in the subcategory [3D Modelling](http://gamestart2finish.blogspot.co.nz/search/label/3DModelling) so it is easy to locate. Content which is used in a game in some form will not be put into this category only the modelling and all it entails within Maya or other 3D modelling software will be separated.
