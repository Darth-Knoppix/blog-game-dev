It's been almost a year since my last post so what's happening?  
  
I have taken a year off university for full time work and some more travelling. I have put my projects on the back burner for the past year with little time to dedicate to them properly but I plan to start something new within the next few weeks.  
  
I have dabbled in a few possible projects involving more bare-bones frameworks rather than fully fledged game engines such as Unreal and Unity3D, although they are fun and easy to use it is sometimes more interesting to dive into the unknown and get your hands dirty in code. Some possibilities I evaluated were HTML5 game design using JS and the new HTML5 canvas technologies and even MonoGame. These two options are very interesting because they offer compatibility across a wide range of devices through the proliferation of the web and cross compilation respectively.  
  
The downside to these frameworks is the learning curve, it is not necessarily difficult but it does mean less results early on due to my busy schedule, it would require a lot of self-motivation to drive forward to get into the early stages of actual development.  
  
For my next project, check back in the coming days for the announcement and hopefully some early work.
