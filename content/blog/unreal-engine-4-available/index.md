I have been looking forward to seeing the new iteration of the Unreal Engine, I have been seeing videos of UE4 for quite a while and while the graphically the demos are looking very good, the tools look even better.  
  
Now that it is actually available I want to play around with it and see what I can do, I think it will be much easier to get started and now with access to the full source, I can learn more about how the systems work together behind the scenes.  
  
The PlayStation Mobile development will be scrapped for now but expect more content soon as I explore Unreal Engine 4. I will hopefully make another small project similar to my UDK project but I will focus more on the gameplay through the new and improved Kismet editor.  
  
The [website](https://www.unrealengine.com/) for the engine has also been improved greatly which should make it easier to find information.
